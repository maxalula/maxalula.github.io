            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>This 3 game series was my first contact with programming and game design.</p>
            <p>It is a series of platform games with engaging mechanics and enemies.</p>
            <p>It was built using Macromedia Flash Player 8, and ActionScript as the scripting language.</p>
            <p>The last game was released in october, 2009.</p>

            <h2>My Contribuitions</h2>
            <p>There was a lot of challenges during these projects, and much more learning than I could have ever imagined. In those I could grasp the understanting of object oriented programming, actions, events and input management.</p>
