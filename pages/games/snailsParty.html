            <h2>My Contribuitions</h2>
           <p>I've developed the multiplayer module using Photon Fusion, ensuring smooth synchronization across player interactions, game logic, and animations.</p>
           <p>Crafting a robust and intuitive UI system was another crucial focus, making the game accessible and visually engaging.</p>
           <p>Game States were meticulously designed to manage transitions between player turns, mini-games, and board progression seamlessly.</p>
           <p>I've also worked on the animation blending, aiming for smoother transitions.</p>
           <p>My role also touches game design, as in the balacing of the game; I've developed the item's effects and power levels, and balaced via playtests.</p>
