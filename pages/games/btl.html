                    <h2>My Contribuitions</h2>
                   <p>This was a portifolio game, with many 3D assets from the Unity asset store. I focused on developing my game design and programming skills.</p>
                   <p>Further into it's phase 2 development, the second version and server was remade with friends from college that took care of 3d, UI and animation to make it unique.</p>
                   <p>Since it was my first contact with Multiplayer programming, it was a challenge, but also an opportunity for growth.</p>
                   <p>My role also touches game design, as in the balacing of the game; I've developed the item's effects and power levels, and balaced via playtests.</p>
